            <h2>About CossiePlay</h2>

            <p>CossiePlay is a family-run local business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding
                custom-made costumes. <b>Cosplayers can order any kind of costume</b> - from simple Spiderman or elf
                costumes
                right up to costumes including advanced features like <b>armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and
                    working force
                    fields</b>. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between <b>1 and 50 weeks</b> and cost
                between <b>$10 and $10,000</b>.
                We <b>buy and sell second-hand costumes</b> (a price list is available) as well.
                On the <b>first Saturday of every month</b> we hold a <b>“CossiePlay Party”</b> at the town hall. Entry
                is <b>$15 for
                    adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free</b>. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink
                and a glow
                stick. Parties <b>start at 6pm and run until 11pm</b>. There is always a ,<b>live DJ</b> at the party
                <b>(who takes requests)</b> and
                dancing is common (but not required).
            </p>

            <h2>Party Guidelines</h2>

            <p>
                CossiePlay party-goers party at their <b>own risk</b> and are responsible for their own safety. <b>Check
                with your
                doctor</b> before you party hard. <b>Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted.
                Credit card payments
                attract a 2% surcharge</b>. Alcohol is served at the bar to over <b>18s only. No intoxicated persons
                will be served</b>,
                but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.
